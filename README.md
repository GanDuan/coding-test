# Background

At Solve's Broken Down lead deposit in rural Tasmania, resource drilling routinely acquires geochemical assays in all its [drill holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_diamond_drilling). These assays give an indication of the metal abundances for each sample, which in turn helps us characterise the orebody and surrounding rockmass.

Recently, a geochemical consultant noticed that changes in the relative metal abundances could potentially be used to indicate proximity to the main orebody. Using a simple euclidean distance measure, she calculated the distance from each sample to the orebody wireframe (red) and then using that distance she classifies samples into two groups: A (proximal - Red/Green) and B (Distal - White).
